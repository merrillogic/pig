GENERAL QUESTIONS
------------------------------
What do we hope to get out of this?


How legal is this?


How can the information we get from this be used? (possibly less our problem?)


How much do we care if our honeynet is detected by attackers?




ATTACK-RELATED QUESTIONS
------------------------------
Who can we expect to be attacking this network?
- Probably mostly script kiddies.  Perhaps a very occasional more advanced hacker, but odds are more on script kiddies.
- I don't know who they are, but individual machines on the Math/CS network get hit and probed and have people trying to SSH into them all the time.
- We could also attack it ourselves.

What sort of methods might they use?
- Mostly pre-established exploits, use of sscan, nmap, Nessus (as general "find-any-weakness" tools)

How can we defend against these attacks?
- Do we want to defend against these attacks?

To what degree do we want to defend against these attacks? (That is, where are we on the spectrum of gaining information vs. blocking attacks?)
- Since this is supposed to be an isolated network, probably more on info-gathering side.

What sort of information will we be getting from attacks?


SETUP QUESTIONS
------------------------------
What are the significant parts of the Honeynet?
- Honeywall machine, logging machine, honeypot systems, ...?

What sort of system(s) should we provide to be both an enticing target and a useful source of information?


How many machines do we need to use?
- Logging machine
- Honeywall
- Depending on how many machines we get to use, we may want to use VMs for the Honeypots.

What specific mechanisms can we use for different parts of the Honeynet?
- Seems like using the systems provided by Honeynet.org is probably the best best (both Georgia Tech and U Wisconsin did so, and they seem to have gotten plenty of useful info)
- One benefit of doing it this way is we can then spend more time on things like analysis and making tools for analysis.

How should each machine be set up?


How do we make this safe, so that we don't compromise the Carleton network?
- Restrict it at the router/firewall level. Don't let any traffic out. ITS may give us a specific subnet even so that they can also block our traffic.


SUPER-SPECIFIC QUESTIONS
------------------------------
Specifically what benign traffic should we expect to see on these systems?
- None! "Since honeypots are not production systems, the honeynet itself has no production activity, no authorized services. As a result, any interaction with a honeynet implies malicious or unauthorized activity. Any connections intiated inbound to your honeynet are most likely a probe, scan, or attack. Any unauthorized outbound connections from your honeynet imply someone has compromised a system and has initiated outbound activity."


What sort of warning mechanisms can we have set up to flag if harmful traffic is leaving the honeynet?
- Don't let harmful traffic leave the honeynet! Reality is probably not this simple.
