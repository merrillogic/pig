HONEYNET COMPS DESIGN DOC
By Jon, Chris, Andy, Tsusa, and Denis


PURPOSE
=====================
The purpose of our comps project is to implement a network-monitoring
suite for detecting and providing information on malicious attacks on a subnet
of the Carleton network.


SETUP 
=====================
We are using the Honeywall OS provided by The Honeynet Project
(honeynet.org) to function as a network traffic controller.  The honeywall is
set up as an invisible network bridge on a VLAN that has been isolated from the
remainder of the Carleton network for security purposes.

Our honeypots will be set up as three virtual machines running Red Hat
Enterprise Linux 6, installed on two computers also running Red Hat as the base
system.  One of the VMs will be running an Apache/MySQL server combination.
Another will run an FTP server, and the third will host an IMAP/SMTP server
combination. All machines will be running SSH servers.


ATTACKS 
=====================
We will be working with three specific types of attacks: password
cracking, man-in-the-middle attacks, and SQL injection attacks, and we may make
use of some long-standing stand-alone exploits (FTP, for example, is lousy with
these).  We will use these attacks ourselves against the honeypot machines in
order to gather sufficient specific data to make use of it in our software.
Aside from these, we may experience other attacks from outside sources.


SOFTWARE 
=====================
Our software will be based around finite state automata-like threat
detectors. For each honeypot, we monitor the incoming traffic, and maintain
information on whether or not the traffic is similar to one of our three known
attacks. If any threats are detected, the software can send notifications, close
connections or just log that it occurred. Real time threat analysis data is
displayed in an online interface.

We will also implement previous attack information in this web interface. A
history of network activity will be displayed, along with any attacks that
occurred, IPs that are potentially malicious, and various other information.
