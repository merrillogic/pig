1. Log traffic with Wireshark or the router/switch machine.
    - figure out HOW
    - parse the file format: either <https://github.com/r1chardj0n3s/parse> or regular expressions will probably help. also, fuzzy string matching: <https://github.com/seatgeek/fuzzywuzzy>

2. Background process watching logfile
    - parse packets from log into Packet objects

3. background worker classifies packets into Attack objects

4. Django views either do long-polling or request some JSON blob regularly and update data on the page
    - there are ways to push over javascript. comet maybe? Andy has never used any and doesn't remember too much about them.
    - or regularly hit /attacks?since=time
    - KnockoutJS ViewModels will store data as JS objects, and magically update elements it's bound too.
