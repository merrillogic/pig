analyzers.py

Basic file for defining the different attack profiles
Functions to use are:
- addPrelimNode() :: adds a Node at the PRELIM threat level
    @return - The integer index of the added node
- addThreatNode() :: adds a Node at the THREAT threat level
    @return - The integer index of the added node
- addTransition(src, dest, score, triggers) :: adds a scored transition between
  the src and dest nodes
    @param src - Integer index of the Node to transition from
    @param dest - Integer index of the Node to transition to
    @param score - Numerical attack score to be assigned to the transition
    @param triggers - List of boolean functions to be satisfied in order to
        make the transition
