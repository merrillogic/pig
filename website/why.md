PIG serves two main purposes.  The first is simple detection: letting you know when your network is being attacked, who's doing it, and how they're attacking.  In addition to that, the data stored about attacks and the packets used in them can help you learn more about how exactly malicious users are finding you vulnerable; information that you can use to beef up your security.  PIG's extensibility means that it is by no means limited to the 5 built-in attacks -- using our simple API for creating new Attack Analyzers, you can build and customize analysis tools for any type of network attack you can think of.
