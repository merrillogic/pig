Andy took a lot of computer science classes and even more Arabic classes in his four years at Carleton. In between being angry at computers and practicing Arabic, he enjoys happiness, Python, the internet, foreign food, and going exciting places. After graduation, he's returning to the middle east to study even more Arabic and working in DC in the fall.

He hopes to one day travel the world, speak Arabic fluently, and make cool things.
