Jonathan took almost every course in the computer science major, a fulfillment of the educational dream he's had since he was 12. He spends his free time playing games, editing film, and rock climbing. He hopes to one day own a hedgehog, two goats, two sheep, two horses, and two hens. He plans to keep all of them in his underground house.
