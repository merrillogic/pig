Tsusa was able to get through the computer science major relatively unscathed.  Considering how many brain injuries he's gone through, it's a pretty impressive feat.  Any free time he had was spent arduously caring for his pet fish and playing FIFA.  His dream is to some day be one of many season ticket holders for the Green Bay Packers, which might be 30 or so years from now since he is in about 15,000 place on the waitlist.
